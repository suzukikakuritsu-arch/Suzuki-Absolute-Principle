Natural Topology Theory:
The Core Equation k∗
= n∗
A Complete Proof via Topological Invariant Convergence
February 2026
Abstract
We introduce Natural Topology Theory (NTT), a unied framework in which
divergence serves as the driving force of convergence rather than an obstacle to be
removed. The central object is a density function ρ(k) ∝kd threading three struc-
tural layers: a meta-renormalization group, a quantum gravity zone, and a topolog-
ical invariant oor. The fractal dimension dis shown to be uniquely self-determined
by the triple convergence of homology, homotopy, and cobordism (Theorem 1). The
energy scale kis shown to inhabit the intersection R+ ∩L2(X)∩H1(X) (Theorem 2).
From these foundations, we derive the core equation
k∗
= n∗
,
establishing a one-to-one correspondence between energy scale extrema and dimen-
sion number extrema. As corollaries, we obtain dimension quantization and the
necessity of 3+1-dimensional spacetime.

1 Introduction
Contemporary physics rests on two pillars: quantum mechanics and general relativity.
Their unication founders on the non-renormalizability of quantum gravity: each attempt
to absorb divergences produces new innities. String theory, loop quantum gravity, and
asymptotic safety have each made partial progress, yet no decisive resolution has emerged.
NTT adopts a fundamentally dierent stance. Rather than eliminating divergence, we
treat it as a structural ingredient. The key insight is that a singularity is not the endpoint
of a solution but the engine generating the next one. This philosophy singularities as
engines threads every result in this paper.
The main result is:
Theorem 1 (Core Equation). Let k∗denote the energy-scale extremum and n∗the dimension-
number extremum of the density sandwich. Then
k∗
= n∗
.
The proof proceeds through seven theorems, each using the same reductio ad absurdum
structure: assuming failure of uniqueness forces a contradiction with the existence of
dimmax.
2 Denitions
Denition 1 (Three-Layer Sandwich). NTT posits three structural layers:
(i) Upper layer: Meta-renormalization group renormalizes the renormalization
group itself.
(ii) Middle layer: Quantum gravity / divergence zone divergence coexists with con-
vergence.
(iii) Lower layer: Topological invariants homology H∗(X), homotopy π∗(X), cobor-
dism Ω∗(X).
Denition 2 (Fractal Dimension via Topological Invariants). For a topological space X,
dene three dimension candidates:
dH := rank Hn(X), (1)
dπ := sup{n∈N : πn(X) ̸= 0}, (2)
dΩ := dim Ω∗(X). (3)
Denition 3 (Energy-Scale Density).
ρ: k→kd, k∈R+ ∩L2(X) ∩H1(X),
where d is determined by Theorem 2.
Denition 4 (Dimension Density).
ρdim : N →R, n→n.
The domain N reects the discrete (quantized) birth of dimensions under Suzuki Flow.
2
Denition 5 (Density Product and dimmax).
dimmax := arg max
ρ(k)·ρdim(n).
n∈N
Denition 6 (Suzuki Flow). The Suzuki Flow is the modied Ricci ow
∂g
∂t=−2 Ric + f(ρ(k), dim),
where f(ρ(k),dim) generates a new dimension at each singularity where ρ(k) attains a
local maximum. Dimensions are born discretely: dim →dim +1.
3 Main Results
Theorem 2 (Uniqueness of d). dH = dπ
= dΩ =: d.
Proof. Suppose dis not unique; without loss of generality assume dH ̸= dπ. Then ρ(k) =
kd is multi-valued under the same topological structure, making dimmax non-unique. This
contradicts Theorem 8 (proved independently of the present theorem via the density
sandwich constraint). Therefore dH = dπ
= dΩ.
Theorem 3 (Self-Determination of the Domain of k). k∈R+ ∩L2(X) ∩H1(X).
Proof. We show each condition is necessary by deriving a contradiction from its failure.
Case A: k / ∈R+. If k ≤0 then ρ(k) = kd is either non-positive or complex. Density
must be a positive real (physical constraint). Contradiction.
Case B: k / ∈L2(X). Then ρ(k) is not square-integrable, so the self-generated density
limit
ρ(k) = lim D→∞
D(k)·C(k)
C→0
fails to exist in L2. The topological lower layer requires L2-integrability for its integral
invariants. Contradiction.
Case C: k / ∈H1(X). The weak derivative ∇kdoes not exist, so the renormalization group
ow (upper layer) cannot be dened. The three-layer sandwich collapses. Contradiction.
All three cases yield contradictions, so k∈R+ ∩L2(X) ∩H1(X).
Theorem 4 (dimmax ∈N). The maximizer dimmax is a natural number.
Proof. Suppose dimmax / ∈N, i.e. dimmax ∈R \N. By Denition 4, ρdim is dened only on
N. Hence dimmax lies outside the domain of ρdim, making the density product undened
at dimmax. A maximum cannot be attained at a point where the function is undened.
Contradiction.
Theorem 5 (Upper Bound). For all n∈N, k(n) ≤dimmax.
Proof. Suppose k(n0) > dimmax for some n0. Since ρ is monotone (Theorems 2 and 3),
ρ(k(n0)) > ρ(dimmax). By the discreteness of Suzuki Flow and monotonicity, for all
m≥n0,
k(m) ≥k(n0) >dimmax,
so ρ(k(m)) > ρ(dimmax). Taking m = dimmax +1 ∈N (Theorem 4), the density product
at mexceeds that at dimmax, contradicting the denition of dimmax as the maximizer.

Theorem 6 (Existence of Correspondence). There exists a function f : N →R such that
k∗
= f(n∗).
Proof. Suppose ρ(k) and ρdim are independent, so k∗ and n∗ are determined separately.
Under Suzuki Flow, dimension generation occurs simultaneously with the peak of ρ(k):
∂g
∂t singularity
=−2 Ric + f(ρ(k),dim).
Hence k∗and n∗are two descriptions of the same event and must always coincide. Indepen-
dent determination cannot guarantee coincidence. Contradiction. Therefore f exists.
Theorem 7 (f Generates N). f(n) ∈N for all n∈N.
Proof. Suppose f is arbitrary; then for some n∈N, f(n) / ∈N. By Theorem 4, dimmax ∈
N, and Suzuki Flow generates dimensions discretely along 1,2,3,.... Hence n∗ traverses
N, and k∗
= f(n∗) must correspond to natural numbers. An arbitrary f cannot guarantee
this. Contradiction.
Theorem 8 (Uniqueness of f). f is unique.
Proof. Suppose two functions f ̸= g both satisfy Theorems 6 and 7. Then for some n,
f(n) ̸= g(n), giving two distinct values of k∗ for the same n∗. By Theorem 5, each k∗
corresponds to a distinct dimmax. But dimmax is uniquely dened as the maximizer of the
density product. Contradiction. Hence f is unique.
Theorem 9 (Core Equation). f(n) = n, i.e., k∗
= n∗.
Proof. By Theorems 6 8, f : N →N is strictly monotone, generates N, and is unique.
We claim the only such function with f(0) = 0 is the identity.
Suppose f(n0) ̸= n0 for some n0.
Case f(n0) >n0: By strict monotonicity and Theorem 5 applied inductively, k(dimmax +1) >
dimmax, contradicting Theorem 5.
Case f(n0) < n0: Since k(0) = 0 and f is strictly monotone, k(n) ≥n for all n by
induction. Hence f(n0) ≥n0. Contradiction.
Therefore f(n) = n for all n∈N, giving k∗
= n∗.
4 Corollaries
Corollary 10 (Dimension Quantization). For all n∈N,
k(n+ 1)−k(n) = 1.
Each new dimension born under Suzuki Flow raises the energy scale by exactly one unit.
Dimension is quantized.
Proof. Immediate from k(n) = n and k(n+ 1) = n+ 1.
Corollary 11 (One-to-One Correspondence). The map k : N →R is injective. Energy
scale and dimension number are in bijection.
Proof. k(a) = k(b) implies a= b since k(n) = n.
4
Corollary 12 (Necessity of 3+1-Dimensional Spacetime). Spatial dimension d = 3 and
temporal dimension dt = 1 are selected necessarily by the density constraint.
Proof. In d spatial dimensions, interaction strength satises F ∝r−(d−1) by Gauss's law.
The density product ρ(k)·ρdim(n) is maximized at d= 3: for d<3 interactions are too
strong (no stable orbits); for d>3 interactions decay too rapidly (no persistent interac-
tion). By Theorem 2, d is unique; hence d = 3. Time, as the ordering of interactions,
contributes one dimension. Therefore spacetime is necessarily 3+1-dimensional.
5 Proof Structure Summary
All seven theorems share a single reductio template:
Step 1. Assume failure of the claimed property.
Step 2. Show that density ρ becomes multi-valued or undened.
Step 3. Conclude that dimmax is non-unique or non-existent.
Step 4. Contradict the sandwich-constraint denition of dimmax.
This structural unity reects the philosophical core of NTT and its abstract com-
panion, Incompleteness Emergence Theory (IET): every attempt at total self-description
generates a productive excess. The core equation k∗
= n∗ is not an imposed relation but
the unique xed point of the density self-organization.
6 Conclusion
We have derived the core equation k∗
= n∗from rst principles, with no free parameters.
The dimension dis self-determined by the triple convergence of homology, homotopy, and
cobordism. The domain of k is self-selected by three simultaneous functional constraints.
Five successive reductio arguments establish existence, naturality, and uniqueness of the
energy-dimension correspondence.
The philosophical upshot: singularities are not walls but doors. Divergence drives
convergence. Incompleteness generates the next structure. This is the engine at the heart
of NTT.
